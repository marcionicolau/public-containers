# Project Brief: Public Containers Repository

## Project Overview
A GitHub repository (`marcionicolau/public-containers`) designed to serve as a centralized collection of public Docker containers and container-related resources for various development and deployment scenarios.

## Core Requirements
- **Repository Structure**: Organize Docker containers in a logical, discoverable manner
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive README.md and documentation for each container
- **Public Access**: All containers should be publicly available and well-documented
- **Versatility**: Support various development environments, deployment templates, and specialized container setups

## Project Goals
1. Create a well-organized repository of Docker containers
2. Provide clear documentation and usage instructions
3. Establish a foundation for sharing reusable container configurations
4. Enable easy discovery and deployment of containerized solutions

## Current State
