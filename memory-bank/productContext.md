# Product Context: Public Containers Repository

## Why This Project Exists
The public-containers repository addresses the need for a centralized, well-organized collection of Docker containers that can be easily discovered, understood, and deployed by developers and DevOps teams.

## Problems It Solves
- **Container Discovery**: Eliminates the need to search through multiple sources for common container configurations
- **Documentation Gaps**: Provides comprehensive documentation for each container setup
- **Reusability**: Offers tested, production-ready container configurations
- **Learning Resource**: Serves as examples for Docker best practices and container patterns

## How It Should Work
1. **Organization**: Containers grouped by purpose (development, databases, web servers, etc.)
2. **Documentation**: Each container includes:
   - Clear purpose and use cases
   - Build and run instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Environment variables
   - Volume mappings
   - Network requirements
3. **Accessibility**: Public GitHub repository with clear navigation
4. **Maintenance**: Regular updates and version management

## User Experience Goals
- **Discoverability**: Users can quickly find relevant containers
- **Clarity**: Clear instructions enable immediate use
- **Flexibility**: Containers can be customized for specific needs
- **Reliability**: Well-tested configurations reduce deployment issues

## Target Users
- Software developers setting up development environments
- DevOps engineers deploying applications
- Students learning containerization
- Teams needing standardized container configurations
