# Active Context: Public Containers Repository

## Current Work Focus
- **Primary Task**: Initialize memory bank system for the public-containers repository
- **Immediate Goal**: Create foundational documentation files to establish project context
- **Next Phase**: Create comprehensive README.md for the repository

## Recent Changes
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Established core memory bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Project foundation and requirements
  - `productContext.md` - User experience and problem definition
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Repository architecture and organization
  - `techContext.md` - Technical stack and development setup

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization with remaining files:
   - `activeContext.md` (this file)
   - `progress.md` - Current status and achievements
2. Create comprehensive README.md for the repository
3. Establish initial repository structure (containers/ directory)
4. Create documentation templates for future containers

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Repository Structure**: Decided on category-based organization (development, databases, web-servers, tools, examples)
- **Documentation Standards**: Using Markdown format with standardized templates
- **Container Patterns**: Single responsibility principle with environment variable configuration
- **Public Access**: All content must be suitable for public GitHub repository

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First**: Comprehensive documentation before implementation
- **Standardization**: Consistent naming and structure across all containers
- **Security Focus**: No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure containers work across different operating systems

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Repository is completely fresh (no commits yet)
- Need to establish clear patterns early for future contributors
- Memory bank system will help maintain project context across sessions
- Focus on creating reusable, well-documented container configurations
